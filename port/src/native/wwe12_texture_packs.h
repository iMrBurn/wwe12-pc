// WWE '12 texture dumps and texture packs, for modders (docs/mod_maker.md).
//
// Adapted from the texture packs of Kaiko's SvR 2011 port (port/src/native/texture_packs.*, used with
// his permission and credit; the PNG writer and the PNG/DDS readers are his), plugged into re:Blue's
// texture mirror (gpu/native_texture_mirror.cpp, Build2DMirror).
//
// A texture is known by its content hash: XXH3 of its top level's blocks, untiled and tightly packed,
// as the GPU reads them (DXT1/3/5 and 8:8:8:8), so the same texture hashes the same on every run.
//
// Dumps (cvar wwe12_texture_dump): every texture shown is written once to "texture_dumps" beside the
// exe, as <width>x<height>_<format>_<hash16>.png, with the fetch constant's swizzle applied (as it
// looks in the game).
// Packs (cvar wwe12_texture_packs, on by default): any file under "textures" beside the exe (any
// subfolder, mods included) whose name ends with _<hash16> (or is <hash16>) .png or .dds replaces that
// texture, at any resolution. PNGs get a box-filtered mip chain; a DDS (DXT1/3/5 or 32-bit) keeps its
// own mips. Files are read the first time the texture is shown. Of two files with one hash, the first
// one by path wins.
