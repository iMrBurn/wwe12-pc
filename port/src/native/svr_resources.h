// SvR 2008: host resources for the game's own D3D textures and surfaces.
//
// With the null GPU, SvR's D3D library creates real guest resources (headers + physical memory)
// itself; the native renderer gives each a host counterpart the first time it's used. Surfaces
// become host render targets; resolve destinations (including the front buffer) become host
// textures the GPU writes; any other texture is mirrored from guest memory (native_texture_mirror).
