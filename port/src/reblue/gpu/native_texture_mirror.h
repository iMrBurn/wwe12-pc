/**
 * @file  gpu/native_texture_mirror.h
 * @brief   Registry and builder for BD native (bdAllocRenderBuffer) content
 *          textures, keyed by guest VA. Native textures are engine-allocated
 *          outside any hooked D3D create API, so HostResourceHeap has no
 *          GuestTexture for them. The bdAllocRenderBuffer hook decodes the
 *          Xenos fetch constant, untiles the DXT data and registers a host BC
 *          mirror here. LoadTexture__vf03 evicts on free.
